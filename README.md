# MHBootstrap
I will be using Bootstrap to build a website &amp; gain more knowledge on the framework 

Learned accordions and hamburger menu's anmd implemented them in the webpage. Also class shortcuts and the different uses of modal's from getbootstrap.com. Fully functionable 

I chose to do a mental health guided bootstrap website because mental health is extremely important to me.
